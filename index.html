<h1>*GAME ABOUT CLIMBING*</h1>
  <h3>version 1.0; 19/10/2023</h3>
<p>The idea is to enhance the game I made few years ago.</p>
  
  <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
<p>
  There will be 2 characters with abilities (strength, technique and rope management). They are going to have an inventory. 
  In that invenotry there would (or would not) be [pitons & hammer], [camalots], [wedges], [carabiners], [climbing guide].
</p>

  <h2>MAP</h2>
<p>
  There will be a <i>Lobby</i> from which you can proceed to the <i>Shop</i> or <i>Climbing areas</i>. 
  In <i>Shop</i> you can buy [pitons & hammer], [camalots], [wedges], [carabiners], [climbing guide].
  In <i>Climbing areas</i> there are gonna be many routes with different difficulty, length, ... (maybe there would be different dificulty in between of protection possibilities?)
