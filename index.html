<h1>*GAME ABOUT CLIMBING*</h1>

<h3>version 1.1; 24/11/2023</h3>
    <p>
        Main goal is to get to the top of Triglav, slovenian highest peak. There are many routes one can use to ascend to Triglav,
        but I will focus only on the climbing ones. But there is also a lot of other peaks in Julian Alps a novice can try before Triglav.
    </p>
    <h2>CLIMBING AREAS</h2>
        <p>
            The routes will be taken from <i>https://www.bergsteigen.com/</i> and adapted for the needs of this project. 
        </p>
        <h3><i>climbing_section</i></h3>
            <p>
                <i>strength</i> and <i>technique</i> and <i>protection_placing</i> difficulities
            </p>
    <h2>CHARACTER ABILITIES</h2>
        <p>
            type: bool >>> <i>is_alive</i> :: :: :: whether the character is alive (rather preparation for future)
        </p>
        <p>
            type: integer (probably 1-100); will be used in tests againts difficulities
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>strength</i>, <i>technique</i>, 
            <i>protection_placing</i> (whether a character is able to place a protection e.g. see a crack, nest, hourglasses... 
                test against characteristic of a <i>climbing_section</i>)
            
            <i>health</i>, <i>tiredness</i> (preparation for future)
            <i>rope_management</i> (preparation for future; will affect HP loss when fall occurs and stamina loss while climbing multipitch)
        </p>
        <p>
            INVENTORY: climbing guide (there are information about the routes) & other stuff
        </p>


<h3>version 1.0; 19/10/2023</h3>
    <p>The idea is to enhance the game I made few years ago.</p>
    <h2>CHARACTERS</h2>
        <p>
            There will be 2 characters with abilities (strength, technique and rope management). They are going to have an inventory. 
            In that invenotry there would (or would not) be [pitons & hammer], [camalots], [wedges], [carabiners], [climbing guide].
        </p>
    <h2>MAP</h2>
        <p>
            There will be a <i>Lobby</i> from which you can proceed to the <i>Shop</i> or <i>Climbing areas</i>. 
            In <i>Shop</i> you can buy [pitons & hammer], [camalots], [wedges], [carabiners], [climbing guide].
            Many routes are going to be in <i>Climbing areas</i> with different difficulty, length, protection possibilities, ... 
        </p>

<h3>Compute area and circumference of a circle</h3>
    <p>radius <input id="radius" size=40> m </p>
    <p><button onClick='compute()'>Compute</button></p>
    <p><div id="results"></div></p>
    <script type='text/javascript'>
        function compute() {
            var r = document.getElementById('radius').value;
            var area = Math.PI * r * r;
			var circ = Math.PI * r * 2;
            var str = "Area is " + area + " m^2 and circumference " + circ + " m"; 
			var str_cr = 'Circumference: ' + circ + ' m';
            document.getElementById("results").innerHTML = str;
			//document.getElementById("results").innerHTML = str_cr;
         }
